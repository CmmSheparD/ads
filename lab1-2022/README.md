## Building

Classic for cmake - create a build directory, go there, then `cmake ${path-to-folder-with-root-cmake-file}`. Then `make` or something that is generated in your case. Googletest package will be automaticly loaded localy (at least I hope so). Build generates only tests and an object file for the main code. Tests should be in the build/test directory.
